# Physics-215-Julia
## Computational Methods of Physics

### Description
Numerical methods; introduction to linear and dynamic programming; principles of
simulation and modeling; computer languages for numerical solutions and algebraic
manipulations

#### Course credit: 3.0 u

### Course Goals
<br/> At the end of the semester, the student will be able to
<br/> 1. [G1] Identify basic principles in high-performance computation especially those accessible via Julia as a programming language;
<br/> 2. [G2] Solve at least one ODE-based problem using numerical approach in Julia, showing the solutions in graphical plots;
<br/> 3. [G3] Implement known numerical methods for solving or simulating basic physical models using Julia as the programming language;
<br/> 4. [G4] Identify critical principles of simulation and modeling in at least one project involving physical system modeling or simulation;
<br/> 5. [G5] Submit at least one completed project implemented using Julia programming language clearly demonstrating at least two out of the first four (G1-G4) above.
